      <p>1. What documents do I need for international travel?</p>

        <p>For international travel, you typically need a valid passport, and depending on the destination, you may require a visa, travel insurance, and vaccinations. It's essential to check the specific entry requirements of your destination well in advance to ensure a smooth journey.</p>
        2. How early should I arrive at the airport before my flight?

        <p>It's recommended to arrive at least 2-3 hours before an international flight and 1-2 hours before a domestic flight. This allows ample time for check-in, security screening, and any unforeseen delays.</p>
        3. Do I need travel insurance?

        <p>While not mandatory, travel insurance is highly recommended to cover unforeseen events like trip cancellations, medical emergencies, or lost luggage. It provides peace of mind and financial protection during your travels.</p>
        4. How do I stay connected while traveling internationally?

        <p>Consider getting a local SIM card, an international phone plan, or using apps like WhatsApp or Skype for communication. These options can help you stay connected without incurring high roaming charges.</p>
        5. Is the tap water safe to drink?

        <p>It varies by destination. In some countries, tap water is safe to drink, while in others, it's advisable to consume bottled or purified water. Always check local advisories to ensure your safety.</p>
        6. What should I do in case of an emergency or if I lose my passport?

        <p>Contact the local embassy or consulate immediately. It's also advisable to keep a copy of your passport and important documents in a separate place as a precaution.</p>
        7. How can I avoid jet lag?

        <p>Adjust your sleep schedule before the trip, stay hydrated, and try to adapt to the local time zone as soon as possible. These practices can help minimize the effects of jet lag.</p>
        8. Can I get a refund for a canceled flight or accommodation?

        <p>It depends on the airline or accommodation policy. Some may offer refunds, credits, or allow rescheduling. It's important to review the terms and conditions at the time of booking.</p>
        9. How can I avoid currency exchange fees?

        <p>Consider using credit cards with no foreign transaction fees or withdrawing cash from ATMs with favorable exchange rates. Always notify your bank of your travel plans to avoid any service disruptions.</p>
        10. What's the best way to share my travel experiences with friends and family?

        <p>You can share photos and updates through social media, create a travel blog, or simply send emails with highlights. These methods allow you to keep your loved ones informed and engaged with your journey.</p>
